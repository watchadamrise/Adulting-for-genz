WORKPLACE ETIQUETTE: HOW TO NOT GET FIRED IN YOUR
FIRST 90 DAYS
The Reality Check Your School Never Gave You
WORK IS NOT SCHOOL (AND YOUR BOSS IS NOT YOUR PARENT)
The biggest shock to your system: work operates by completely different rules than school. In
school, you could negotiate deadlines, get extensions, and still pass with minimal effort. At work,
deadlines are real, performance matters, and "good enough" can get you replaced.
WHY? Because school exists to educate you - work exists to make money. Your employer isn't
invested in your personal growth or self-esteem. They're paying you to solve problems and add
value. If you can't do that reliably, they'll find someone who can.
The fundamental difference:
School: You pay them, so they work with you
Work: They pay you, so you work for them
School: Multiple chances to improve your grade
Work: Performance reviews matter, but daily performance matters more
School: Teachers want you to succeed
Work: Your boss wants results, regardless of your feelings
What This Means for You:
No participation trophies - you get paid for results, not effort
No extended deadlines - business doesn't stop for your personal issues
No arguing with the teacher - your boss makes decisions, you execute them
No parents to call - you handle your own problems or face consequences
No summer break - work continues whether you feel like it or not
ATTENDANCE: THE NON-NEGOTIABLE FOUNDATION
Showing up is literally the bare minimum requirement of employment. You can't contribute value if
you're not there. "Not feeling it today" is not a valid reason to skip work.
WHY? Because your absence affects other people's ability to do their jobs. When you don't show
up, someone else has to cover your responsibilities, customers don't get served, and deadlines
get missed. Your "mental health day" becomes everyone else's stressful day.
The Reality of Attendance:
In School: Missing class mainly affects your grades At Work: Missing work affects your paycheck,
your coworkers, your customers, and your job security
Acceptable Reasons to Miss Work:
Genuine illness (you're contagious or physically unable to work)
Family emergency (death, hospital, serious crisis)

Pre-approved time off (requested and approved in advance)
Weather emergencies (roads closed, dangerous conditions)
Unacceptable Reasons to Miss Work:
"Not feeling it" - your mood doesn't determine business operations
Hangover/partied too hard - your choices, your consequences
Better offer came up - you made a commitment when you took the job
Mental health day - plan these in advance or use established leave policies
Car trouble - this is your responsibility to solve, not your boss's problem
The Professional Approach to Sick Days:
1. Call as early as possible - don't text, actually call
2. Be brief and professional - "I'm ill and won't be able to come in today"
3. Don't overshare - they don't need details about your symptoms
4. Ask about coverage - "Should I reach out to anyone about covering my shift?"
5. Follow company policy - know how many sick days you have and how to use them
PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION: YOUR WORDS HAVE
CONSEQUENCES
How you communicate at work directly affects how people perceive your competence, maturity,
and professionalism. Texting your boss "yo can't make it lol" is a career-limiting move.
WHY? Because communication style signals respect level and professional capability. If you can't
communicate professionally, people assume you can't handle professional responsibilities. Your
casual communication makes others question your judgment and reliability.
Email/Text Standards:
Professional Email Format:
What NOT to Do:
"hey can't come in lol" - unprofessional tone
"omg so stressed rn" - oversharing personal feelings
"k thx" - dismissive and lazy
All lowercase or ALL CAPS - shows lack of care
Excessive emojis - this isn't social media
Subject: [Clear, specific subject line]
Subject: [Clear, specific subject line]
Hi [Name],
Hi [Name],
[Clear, concise message with proper grammar and spelling]
[Clear, concise message with proper grammar and spelling]
Best regards,
Best regards,
[Your name]
[Your name]

WHY? Because every communication is a reflection of your professionalism. Sloppy
communication suggests sloppy work habits.
Phone/In-Person Communication:
Answer with your name - "This is [Your name]"
Speak clearly and at appropriate volume - mumbling isn't professional
Listen before responding - don't interrupt or finish sentences
Use complete sentences - "yeah," "nope," and "whatever" aren't professional responses
End calls/conversations properly - "Thank you, have a good day"
Digital Communication Boundaries:
Work communication stays professional - save casual chat for personal relationships
Response time matters - acknowledge messages within reasonable timeframes
Use appropriate channels - urgent matters get calls, not texts
Proofread before sending - typos make you look careless
DRESS CODE: YOUR APPEARANCE IS YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION
Your outfit communicates your level of respect for the workplace, your role, and your colleagues.
Showing up in pajamas or inappropriate clothing signals that you don't take the job seriously.
WHY? Because whether it's fair or not, people judge your competence based on your
appearance within the first 30 seconds of meeting you. Your clothes either support your
professional credibility or undermine it before you even speak.
Understanding Dress Codes:
Business Professional:
Men: Suits, dress shirts, ties, dress shoes
Women: Business suits, blouses, dress shoes, conservative dresses
Everyone: Well-groomed, minimal jewelry, professional appearance
Business Casual:
Men: Khakis/dress pants, collared shirts, loafers/dress shoes
Women: Slacks/skirts, blouses/sweaters, closed-toe shoes
Everyone: Clean, pressed clothing, professional grooming
Casual/Uniform:
Follow company guidelines exactly - don't interpret loosely
Clean and well-fitting - even casual clothes should look intentional
Appropriate for customer interaction - you represent the company
Universal Don'ts:
Pajamas, sweats, or sleep clothes - signals you didn't care enough to get dressed
Revealing clothing - unprofessional and potentially illegal workplace harassment
Offensive graphics/text - your political/personal opinions don't belong on work clothes

Excessive jewelry/accessories - distracting from your work performance
Strong fragrances - can trigger allergies and headaches in others
Dirty or wrinkled clothing - suggests poor attention to detail
WHY? Because your appearance affects how customers, colleagues, and supervisors interact with
you. Looking professional gets you taken seriously; looking sloppy gets you overlooked for
opportunities.
CUSTOMER SERVICE: IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
If your job involves customer interaction, your personal feelings about customers are irrelevant. Your
job is to represent the company professionally, regardless of how you feel about individual
customers.
WHY? Because customers pay the company's bills, which pays your salary. Bad customer service
loses business, which eliminates jobs. Your paycheck depends on customers having positive
experiences, even when they're difficult.
The Customer Service Mindset:
You represent the company, not yourself - your personal opinions don't matter
The customer's problem is your work responsibility - solve it or escalate it
Professional demeanor is mandatory - regardless of customer attitude
Company policy applies to everyone - you don't get to make exceptions based on your
feelings
Dealing with Difficult Customers:
1. Stay calm and professional - their emotions don't dictate your response
2. Listen to understand the problem - not to argue or defend
3. Acknowledge their concern - "I understand this is frustrating"
4. Offer solutions within policy - focus on what you CAN do
5. Escalate when necessary - know when to involve a supervisor
What NOT to Do:
Argue with customers - you won't win, and you'll lose your job
Take things personally - their frustration is about the situation, not you
Make exceptions you're not authorized to make - this creates bigger problems
Complain about customers to other customers - unprofessional and stupid
Use your personal phone during customer interactions - completely unacceptable
WHY? Because customer service skills transfer to every job you'll ever have. Learning to handle
difficult people professionally is a career asset that will serve you everywhere.
WORKPLACE RELATIONSHIPS: COWORKERS ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS
This doesn't mean be unfriendly - it means understand the boundaries between professional
relationships and personal friendships. What you say and do at work can and will be used in
employment decisions.

WHY? Because workplace relationships serve professional purposes first. Even if you like your
coworkers personally, your primary relationship is built around work responsibilities. Personal
drama can destroy your professional reputation and career opportunities.
Professional Relationship Guidelines:
Be friendly but maintain boundaries - pleasant to work with, not necessarily hangout buddies
Keep personal information appropriate - they don't need details about your dating life,
family drama, or financial problems
Don't participate in workplace gossip - information travels fast and gets distorted
Support team goals over personal preferences - the work comes first
Handle conflicts professionally - address issues directly and respectfully
Social Media and Workplace:
Don't complain about work/coworkers online - screenshots are forever
Be careful about friend requests - mixing personal and professional social media can backfire
Keep work-related social media professional - your posts reflect on your employer
Don't post during work hours - focus on work while you're being paid
Office Politics Reality:
Every workplace has politics - ignoring them won't make them disappear
Stay neutral in conflicts - taking sides can limit your opportunities
Focus on your performance - excellence speaks louder than popularity
Build professional alliances - relationships that support your work goals
PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS: "GOOD ENOUGH" ISN'T ENOUGH
In school, 70% might be passing. At work, consistently delivering 70% effort gets you fired.
Employers expect consistent, reliable performance at or above standards.
WHY? Because businesses compete in markets where "good enough" loses to competitors who
deliver excellence. Your performance directly affects company success, which determines
whether your job continues to exist.
What Employers Actually Expect:
Consistent quality - not perfect, but reliably meeting standards
Timely completion - deadlines are commitments, not suggestions
Problem-solving initiative - identify issues and propose solutions
Continuous improvement - get better at your job over time
Professional attitude - handle challenges without drama
The Performance Review Reality:
"Meets Expectations" = Average Performance
You're doing your job adequately
You're not at risk of being fired
You're also not likely to get promoted or raises

"Exceeds Expectations" = Career Growth
You're adding more value than required
You're likely to receive opportunities and advancement
You're building a reputation as a high performer
Taking Initiative:
Ask for additional responsibilities when you've mastered current ones
Identify process improvements and suggest them appropriately
Help coworkers when your work is complete - builds team reputation
Seek feedback and act on it - shows commitment to improvement
Document your achievements - for performance reviews and resume building
COMMON MISTAKES THAT GET YOU FIRED
These are the career-ending moves that seem obvious to everyone except the people making them:
The "School Mentality" Mistakes:
Negotiating deadlines after they're set
WHY? Because business deadlines are often connected to customer commitments, other
departments' schedules, and revenue targets. Missing them costs money.
Expecting praise for basic requirements
WHY? Because doing your job correctly is the minimum expectation, not an achievement.
Recognition comes from exceeding expectations, not meeting them.
Taking feedback personally instead of professionally
WHY? Because feedback is about job performance, not personal worth. Defensive reactions to
feedback signal you're not coachable.
The "Social Media Generation" Mistakes:
Oversharing personal information
WHY? Because TMI makes people uncomfortable and questions your judgment about
appropriate boundaries.
Treating workplace like social hour
WHY? Because you're being paid to work, not socialize. Excessive personal conversation
interferes with productivity.
Recording/photographing workplace without permission
WHY? Because this violates privacy, potentially breaks confidentiality agreements, and shows
poor judgment about professional boundaries.
The "Instant Gratification" Mistakes:
Expecting immediate promotion/raises

WHY? Because career advancement requires proven performance over time. You have to earn
opportunities through consistent results.
Job hopping for small pay increases
WHY? Because frequent job changes signal unreliability and prevent you from building deep
skills and professional relationships.
Using personal phone excessively during work
WHY? Because it signals that personal priorities take precedence over work responsibilities, and
customers/coworkers notice.

FINAL WORDS: YOUR CAREER STARTS WITH YOUR FIRST JOB
How you handle your first job sets the pattern for your entire career. The habits you build, the
reputation you establish, and the skills you develop will follow you to every future opportunity.
Employers talk to each other. Your reputation in the industry starts with your first workplace
behavior. Excellence opens doors; unprofessionalism closes them permanently.
The workplace skills you learn early become automatic later. Professional communication,
reliable attendance, customer service excellence, and team collaboration are transferable skills that
make you valuable anywhere.
Your first job is training for your dream job. Every workplace experience teaches you something
about professional success. Use each opportunity to build skills and credibility for bigger
opportunities.
The choice is yours: You can approach work with the maturity and professionalism that leads to
career growth, or you can maintain the casual attitude that leads to constant job searching.
Your paycheck depends on your performance. Your performance depends on your attitude.
Your attitude is the only thing you completely control.
Make it count.
"Work isn't school, your boss isn't your parent, and your paycheck isn't guaranteed. Act accordingly, and
you'll not only keep your job—you'll build a career."
