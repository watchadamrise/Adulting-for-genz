PRESENTATION: FIRST IMPRESSIONS AND PERSONAL
STANDARDS
Looking the Part in Every Situation
FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE VISUAL
Before you open your mouth, people see your clothes, your posture, your grooming—and they form a
judgment. You don't have to wear a suit every day, but you do need to know when to elevate and when to
relax.
WHY? Because looking the part gets you in the room. Staying authentic keeps you there. But if you
show up in sweats to a wedding or wear a tux to game night—you're telling the world you don't
understand context.
The 7-Second Rule: People make judgments about your competence, trustworthiness, and character
within 7 seconds of seeing you. Your appearance is your opening statement before you say a word.
DRESS TO MATCH THE MISSION
Every situation has unspoken dress code expectations. Reading the room and dressing accordingly shows
social intelligence and respect.
Professional Situations:
Job Interview
Wear: Business casual at a minimum (collared shirt, slacks, clean shoes). Suit if it's corporate. Neat and
sharp.
WHY? Because you're competing against people who understand that looking professional is part of
being professional. Don't lose before you speak.
Court Appearance
Wear: Button-up, dress pants, closed-toe shoes. Look responsible and respectful—it matters.
WHY? Because judges and juries make decisions based on first impressions. Looking like you respect
the court shows you respect the process.
Business Meeting/Networking Event
Wear: Business casual or business formal, depending on the industry. When in doubt, slightly
overdress.
WHY? Because opportunities come from people who take you seriously. Dress like someone worth
doing business with.
Social Situations:
Wedding
Wear: At least slacks and a button-up. Dress shoes. Level up based on the couple's vibe or the invite's
tone.
WHY? Because this is their day, not yours. Showing respect through your appearance honors their
celebration.

Funeral
Wear: Dark, subdued colors. No graphics. Button-up or blouse. Clean shoes. Show respect, not flash.
WHY? Because grief deserves dignity. Your appearance should honor the deceased and comfort the
family, not draw attention to yourself.
Date Night
Wear: Smart casual. Clean, fitted clothes that show effort. Read the venue. No gym shorts unless it's a
hike.
WHY? Because effort shows interest. How you present yourself communicates how much you value the
person and the occasion.
Family Dinner
Wear: Casual but clean. Show up like someone they'd be proud to introduce to others.
WHY? Because family sees you at your worst—showing up looking decent proves you still care about
their opinion and the relationship.
Entertainment/Leisure:
Concert/Night Out
Wear: Personal style is fine, but don't go sloppy. Clean, confident, and something you can move in.
WHY? Because you want to enjoy yourself without worrying about wardrobe malfunctions or looking
like you rolled out of bed.
Gym/Athletic Activities
Wear: Appropriate athletic wear, clean and functional. Don't wear street clothes to work out.
WHY? Because the right gear improves performance and shows you understand the environment. Plus,
nobody wants to smell your cotton t-shirt after cardio.
STILL BE YOURSELF
Don't dress like someone you're not. You can stay true to your style while leveling up for the occasion.
Whether it's boots, braids, chains, or sneakers—just keep it sharp and clean.
WHY? Because authenticity matters too. People spot a costume from a mile away. You're not playing
dress-up—you're showing respect without hiding who you are.
Style vs. Appropriateness:
Your style is HOW you wear something
Appropriateness is WHAT you choose to wear
You can have both without compromising either
Examples of Authentic Elevation:
If you're a sneaker person: Clean, quality sneakers instead of beat-up ones
If you wear graphic tees: Choose subtle designs for professional settings
If you have tattoos: Don't hide them, but consider coverage for conservative environments
If you wear jewelry: Scale it appropriately for the situation

BASICS THAT NEVER MISS
Build your wardrobe around versatile pieces that work across multiple situations:
Foundation Pieces:
Fitted black or dark jeans—clean and simple
WHY? Because good jeans work for 80% of social situations and can be dressed up or down.
Neutral t-shirts or polos—solid colors over logos
WHY? Because solid colors are timeless and logos can date you or send unintended messages.
Collared button-up—always a level-up move
WHY? Because a clean button-up instantly makes you look more put-together and can work from
casual to semi-formal.
Clean sneakers or boots—scuffed doesn't mean rugged
WHY? Because your shoes are often the first and last thing people notice. Clean footwear shows
attention to detail.
Optional: watch or one sharp accessory. Not five.
WHY? Because these basics work across nearly every situation. Simple. Flexible. Effective.
The 80/20 Rule:
80% of your wardrobe should be versatile basics that work in multiple situations. 20% can be
statement pieces that express your personality.
HYGIENE: THE NON-NEGOTIABLE FOUNDATION
Hygiene is the practice of keeping yourself and your surroundings clean to maintain health and prevent
illness. It's not just about smelling good—it's about showing respect for yourself and the people around
you.
WHY? Because it keeps you from smelling like a trash can, getting sick, and looking like you gave up
on life.
Daily Hygiene Checklist:
Morning Routine:
Brush your teeth (twice a day—no exceptions)
WHY? Because bad breath kills conversations before they start, and dental problems are expensive
and painful.
Shower or bathe daily
WHY? Because body odor is the fastest way to make people avoid you, and you get used to your own
smell—others don't.
Use deodorant (no one wants your funk)
WHY? Because antiperspirant prevents sweat, deodorant covers odor, and you need both to function
in society.

Wash your face, especially if you're acne-prone or greasy
WHY? Because clear skin makes you look healthier and more confident, and face-touching spreads
bacteria.
Throughout the Day:
Wash your hands with soap—especially after using the bathroom
WHY? Because germs spread through hands faster than any other way, and handshakes are trust
signals.
Keep your nails trimmed and clean
WHY? Because people notice hands during handshakes, and dirty nails suggest poor attention to
detail.
Daily Changes:
Change into clean clothes every day (yes, even socks and underwear)
WHY? Because yesterday's clothes carry yesterday's bacteria, sweat, and odors—even if you can't smell
them.
If you have long hair, keep it clean and brushed
WHY? Because greasy or messy hair makes people think you can't take care of basic responsibilities.
Why Hygiene Matters:
People judge you the second they lay eyes (or noses) on you. Bad hygiene doesn't just gross people out—
it signals laziness, poor self-respect, and lack of discipline. Whether you're applying for a job, dating, or
trying to be taken seriously, hygiene is your silent first impression.
WHY? Because hygiene is respect. For your body. For others. For the people who have to smell you in
line at the DMV.
PRO TIPS YOU SHOULD KNOW
Advanced Hygiene:
Mouthwash helps but doesn't replace brushing or flossing
WHY? Because mouthwash is perfume for your mouth—it covers problems temporarily but doesn't
solve them.
Smell test your armpits before leaving the house—be honest with yourself
WHY? Because you become nose-blind to your own scent, but everyone else notices immediately.
Trim nose and ear hair if it's getting wild
WHY? Because visible nose/ear hair ages you and distracts from your face during conversations.
If you sweat a lot, carry travel deodorant
WHY? Because sweat happens, but being prepared for it shows you care about how you affect others.
Environmental Hygiene:
Change your bedsheets and towels weekly

WHY? Because dirty linens breed bacteria and affect your personal smell even after you shower.
Clip toenails. Yes, people notice them—especially in sandals
WHY? Because no one's going to tell you you stink—they'll just never invite you back. These tips save
you from being that guy.
Grooming Maintenance:
Get regular haircuts—even if you're growing it out
WHY? Because maintained long hair looks intentional; unmaintained hair looks neglected.
Keep facial hair trimmed and shaped
WHY? Because scruffy can be stylish, but unkempt just looks lazy.
Use lip balm—cracked lips are distracting
WHY? Because people focus on your mouth when you're talking, and chapped lips suggest you don't
pay attention to details.
THE CONTEXT PRINCIPLE
Different environments have different standards. Learn to read the room and adjust accordingly:
Professional Environments:
Conservative industries: Bank on looking traditional and polished
Creative industries: Express personality while maintaining professionalism
Trade/labor jobs: Prioritize functionality and safety over fashion
Social Environments:
Upscale venues: Dress to match the establishment's standard
Casual gatherings: Clean and comfortable without being sloppy
Cultural events: Research appropriate attire to show respect
Regional Considerations:
Urban vs. rural: Different areas have different style norms
Climate: Dress appropriately for weather while maintaining standards
Cultural sensitivity: Understand local customs when traveling or in diverse communities
BUILDING YOUR PERSONAL STANDARD
Your presentation should reflect:
Respect for the situation
Respect for other people
Respect for yourself
Understanding of social context
The Daily Standard:
Ask yourself every morning: "Do I look like someone I'd want to be around?"

If the answer is no, fix it before you leave the house.
The Professional Standard:
Ask yourself: "Do I look like someone who can handle responsibility?"
Your appearance should never be the reason you don't get an opportunity.
The Social Standard:
Ask yourself: "Do I look like I care about the people I'm going to see?"
Effort in your appearance shows effort in your relationships.
FINAL WORDS
Your presentation is your first communication with the world. Before you speak, before you act, before
people know anything about your character or capabilities, they see how you present yourself.
Make it count.
You don't need expensive clothes to look good. You need clean clothes that fit well and personal hygiene
that shows you give a damn about yourself and others.
Dress for the job you want, the relationship you want, the respect you want.
Your presentation should open doors, not close them. It should start conversations, not end them. It
should make people curious about who you are, not certain they want to avoid you.
Look the part. Be the part. Earn the part.
"You never get a second chance to make a first impression, but you get multiple chances every day to
maintain your standards."
